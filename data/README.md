# Data: source, files used, and redistribution boundary

The R2 pilot uses left- versus right-hand motor-imagery EEG from **BCI Competition IV dataset 2b** (also described as *BCI Competition 2008 – Graz data set B*), nine participants. The source page lists three EEG and three EOG channels per recording.

**No recording is included in this repository.** Obtain the files yourself from the official source and follow its terms.

## Where the files come from

R2 read the MAT-format release on the BNCI Horizon 2020 database, entry **"4. Two class motor imagery (004-2014)"** at <https://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets>. When read on 2026-10-27, that page listed the files `B01T.mat`, `B01E.mat`, …, `B09T.mat`, `B09E.mat`, stated that the set was originally released as data set 2b of BCI Competition IV, and gave the licence as *Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives 4.0 (CC BY-ND 4.0)* with the Institute for Knowledge Discovery, Graz University of Technology, as licensor. Check the page for the current terms before use.

The BCI Competition IV download area (<https://bbci.de/competition/iv/download/>) distributes the same competition data as GDF files. **R2 did not use the GDF release**, and the file names and hashes below refer to the BNCI MAT files only.

## Files and sessions used

Each MAT container holds several recording sessions as separate groups. R2 used one group per container: **physical session 3** is group index 2 of `B0xT.mat`, and **physical session 4** is group index 0 of `B0xE.mat`. The mapping, expected sizes and SHA-256 values below are copied from [`code/r2/candidate/config/DATA_MANIFEST_v1.json`](../code/r2/candidate/config/DATA_MANIFEST_v1.json) (local paths replaced by `<PROJECT_ROOT>`). They record the files as previously identified in the author's local copy. They were not re-hashed for this showcase, and whether a fresh download today has identical bytes has not been checked.

Participant 2's session-4 group has 120 trials, so its evaluation segment (trial index 40 onward) has 80 trials; every other participant has 120 evaluation trials.

## Redistribution boundary

This repository does not contain the recordings, any modified copy of them, per-trial labels, per-trial predictions, or model weights. It contains aggregate statistics computed from the recordings (see [results/](../results/README.md)) and one fixed bootstrap matrix of participant indices (0–8) that contains no signal or label values ([protocol/README.md](../protocol/README.md)). Public availability of a dataset does not by itself grant permission to redistribute it; this note is a description of what was done, not legal advice.
