# Third-party notices

This repository bundles **no** third-party source code, binaries, datasets or model weights. The items below are used by, or cited in, the R2 pilot and keep their own terms when you obtain them. Licence identifiers for the Python packages were read from the installed package metadata of the original R2 environment on 2026-10-27; consult each project for authoritative terms. This file is informational, not legal advice.

## Python packages (not bundled)

| Package | Version in R2 environment | Role | Licence (package metadata) |
|---|---|---|---|
| NumPy | 2.5.3 | arrays, statistics | BSD-3-Clause AND 0BSD AND MIT AND Zlib AND CC0-1.0 |
| SciPy | 1.18.1 | MAT loading, filtering, optimisation, t distribution | BSD licence (OSI classifier) |
| PyTorch | 2.14.1 | neural decoder training and inference | Apache-2.0 AND Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception AND BSD-2-Clause AND BSD-3-Clause AND BSL-1.0 AND MIT |
| pyRiemann | 0.12 | Riemannian mean in the alignment code (`frozen/ea_recipe_r2.py`), which is outside R2's T/H path; listed because the launcher pins its version | BSD (3-clause) |
| scikit-learn | 1.9.1 | OAS covariance estimator in the same alignment code (outside the T/H path); version pinned by the launcher | BSD-3-Clause |
| Matplotlib | 3.11.2 | the optional results figure only (installed in the R2 environment as a dependency) | Matplotlib licence (PSF-based) |
